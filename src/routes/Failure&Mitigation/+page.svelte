      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Failure Modes in Project</h2>
      <ul>
        <!-- Power Management Failure -->
        <li class="mb-4 bg-violet-200 rounded-l p-4">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Power Management Failure</h3>
          <p><strong>Failure Mode:</strong> Device fails to turn off automatically, leading to battery drain.</p>
          <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Implement rigorous testing of the auto-shutdown feature. Incorporate feedback mechanisms within the software to ensure timely execution of power-off protocols.</p>
        </li>
  
        <!-- Biometric Alert Failure -->
        <li class="mb-4 bg-violet-200 rounded-l p-4">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Biometric Alert Failure</h3>
          <p><strong>Failure Mode:</strong> Inaccurate or delayed alerts for out-of-normal biometrics.</p>
          <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Conduct extensive testing under various scenarios to ensure accuracy and promptness of alerts. Implement a fallback system to notify users in case of sensor malfunctions.</p>
        </li>
  
        <!-- Water Resistance Failure -->
        <li class="mb-4 bg-violet-200 rounded-l p-4">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Water Resistance Failure</h3>
          <p><strong>Failure Mode:</strong> Device malfunctions when exposed to moisture or sweat.</p>
          <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Utilize high-quality water-resistant materials and sealants. Perform rigorous water resistance tests under different conditions to ensure durability.</p>
        </li>
  
        <!-- Overheating Failure -->
        <li class="mb-4 bg-violet-200 rounded-l p-4">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Overheating Failure</h3>
          <p><strong>Failure Mode:</strong> Device exceeds safe temperature limits during prolonged use.</p>
          <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Integrate efficient heat dissipation mechanisms. Monitor device temperature and automatically adjust processing power to prevent overheating.</p>
        </li>
  
        <!-- Hardware Durability Failure -->
        <li class="mb-4 bg-violet-200 rounded-l p-4">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Hardware Durability Failure</h3>
          <p><strong>Failure Mode:</strong> Bracelet material wears or breaks under stress or over time.</p>
          <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Choose durable materials like reinforced silicone or high-grade nylon. Conduct stress tests to ensure the longevity and resilience of the bracelet.</p>
