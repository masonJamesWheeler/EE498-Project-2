Based on the pugh matrix and utility analysis, it is clear that Concept A is the most desirable concept plan because it has a much lower cost and the efficiency is unmatched. Although the features in other concepts for this project are desirable and would make this a competitive item on the market, cost and ease of use including battery life and weight are also important factors to consider.
